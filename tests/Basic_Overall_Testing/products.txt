This property is truly a part of the "OLD WEST". Sierra Blanca was named after Sierra Blanca Mountain, just North-West of town. The town came into existence when competing railroads for a second (Southern) transcontinental railroad line came within 10 miles of one another in 1881. Jay Gould, famous railroad magnate and robber baron, drove a silver spike commemorating the event on Dec. 15th 1881. The town sprang up around that spot, although the population didn't reach 350 people until 1914. It is best described as grazing land that is flat to slightly sloping terrain covered with desert sagebrush and grasses. This acreage is raw unimproved land without publicly maintained roads. Some utilities in the area or that cross part of the ranches include electric, and telephone.</p><h4><b>Use:</b></h4><p>Use the property to camp, hunt (hunting in the area includes big horn sheep, mule deer, javalina, mountain lion, antelope, quail and dove), hike, horseback ride, ATV, vacation, star gaze, build a residence/ranch, hold as an asset for future speculation purposes, or pass it on to the children/ grandchildren, or just to say you own a piece of the great American West, where Blue Skies and Majestic Clouds are common: As they say, "LAND; THEY AREN'T MAKING ANY MORE OF IT!!!</p><h4><b>Zoning:</b></h4><p>As of 8/2008 there are NO COUNTY ZONING RESTRICTIONS on the property. You can build a Ranch / Home, Install a Mobile Home or Commercial Building or simply use it as a camping site when you are in the area. However, as is the case with any city, county or State in the United States you must comply with all permit requirements, building regulations, etc. that may be required by government agencies, prior to building any structures. Keep in mind that this is raw acreage and there are no homeowner services of any kind on the property.</p><h4><b>Access:</b></h4><p>There is LEGAL access to the ranch via Lasca Road, and legal access to each parcel. We are also reserving easements for utility access to each parcel that does not currently have electric on the property.</p><h4><b>Property surveys:</b></h4><p>Parcels 1 thru 26 are surveyed and the corners of each parcel marked as of 08/2007. Some pins were set in various points. Please see the Plat / Subdivision Map for location and type of pins/rods that were set by the surveyor.</p><h4><b>Water:</b></h4><p>The owner of the property has the right to drill a water well . Although we DO NOT guarantee the success of a well or the quality of water, based on well drillers in the area it appears water is found around the 150 to 900 ft depth. For information, we suggest you contact well drillers that perform their services in that area.</p><h4><b>Electric:</b></h4><p>Currently a single power pole runs thru parcels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 22, 24 &amp; 26. (See the Subdivision Map for exact locations) No individual meters have been set. An easement has been reserved across the parcels that have the existing electric line. to insure the other parcels that do not currently have power will be able to bring power to their property in the most efficient manner.</p><h4><b>Mineral Rights:</b></h4><p>All Mineral Rights have been previously reserved by other owner(s)</p><h4><b>Gas:</b></h4><p>Propane is probably your best option.</p><h4><b>Sewer:</b></h4><p>You must install a septic system. We have not had any percolation tests performed on any of the parcels and do not know if the soil conditions are suitable.</p><h4><b>Larger Parcel Availabilty:</b></h4><p>In some cases the adjacent parcel may be available for purchase, or we may switch you to a different parcel that would allow for the purchase of additional parcels. Just contact us.</p><h4><b>Hudspeth County:</b><br/><a href="http://www.co.hudspeth.tx.us/ips/cms" target="top"></a></h4><p><a href="http://www.co.hudspeth.tx.us/ips/cms" target="top">Hudspeth County</a> in the Trans-Pecos region of far-western Texas, is bordered by New Mexico to the north, the Mexican state of Chihuahua to the south, El Paso County to the west, and Culberson and Jeff Davis counties to the east. Sierra Blanca, the county seat, is seventy miles southeast of El Paso in south central Hudspeth County. The county's center lies at approximately 31Â°32' north latitude and 105Â°28' west longitude, about twenty-four miles northwest of Sierra Blanca. Interstate Highway 10 and U.S. Highway 80 cross southern Hudspeth County from east to west, and U.S. highways 62 and 180 cross northern Hudspeth County from east to west.

This property is truly a part of the "OLD WEST". Sierra Blanca was named after Sierra Blanca Mountain, just North-West of town. The town came into existence when competing railroads for a second (Southern) transcontinental railroad line came within 10 miles of one another in 1881. Jay Gould, famous railroad magnate and robber baron, drove a silver spike commemorating the event on Dec. 15th 1881. The town sprang up around that spot, although the population didn't reach 350 people until 1914. It is best described as grazing land that is flat to slightly sloping terrain covered with desert sagebrush and grasses. This acreage is raw unimproved land without publicly maintained roads. Some utilities in the area or that cross part of the ranches include electric, and telephone.</p><h4><b>Use:</b></h4><p>Use the property to camp, hunt (hunting in the area includes big horn sheep, mule deer, javalina, mountain lion, antelope, quail and dove), hike, horseback ride, ATV, vacation, star gaze, build a residence/ranch, hold as an asset for future speculation purposes, or pass it on to the children/ grandchildren, or just to say you own a piece of the great American West, where Blue Skies and Majestic Clouds are common: As they say, "LAND; THEY AREN'T MAKING ANY MORE OF IT!!!</p><h4><b>Zoning:</b></h4><p>As of 8/2008 there are NO COUNTY ZONING RESTRICTIONS on the property. You can build a Ranch / Home, Install a Mobile Home or Commercial Building or simply use it as a camping site when you are in the area. However, as is the case with any city, county or State in the United States you must comply with all permit requirements, building regulations, etc. that may be required by government agencies, prior to building any structures. Keep in mind that this is raw acreage and there are no homeowner services of any kind on the property.</p><h4><b>Access:</b></h4><p>There is LEGAL access to the ranch via Lasca Road, and legal access to each parcel. We are also reserving easements for utility access to each parcel that does not currently have electric on the property.</p><h4><b>Property surveys:</b></h4><p>Parcels 1 thru 26 are surveyed and the corners of each parcel marked as of 08/2007. Some pins were set in various points. Please see the Plat / Subdivision Map for location and type of pins/rods that were set by the surveyor.</p><h4><b>Water:</b></h4><p>The owner of the property has the right to drill a water well . Although we DO NOT guarantee the success of a well or the quality of water, based on well drillers in the area it appears water is found around the 150 to 900 ft depth. For information, we suggest you contact well drillers that perform their services in that area.</p><h4><b>Electric:</b></h4><p>Currently a single power pole runs thru parcels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 22, 24 &amp; 26. (See the Subdivision Map for exact locations) No individual meters have been set.

We will provide you with any information we have regarding the improvements or lack of improvements for each parcel. <a href="http://www.acreage4less.com/lamap2.gif"><span><b>Click here</b></span></a> to see a large detailed map of the general area. <a href="http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/"><span><b>Click here</b></span></a> for information regarding the City of Lancaster. <a href="http://www.cityofpalmdale.org/"><span><b>Click here</b></span></a> for information regarding the City of Palmdale. <a href="http://mapserver.mytopo.com/homepage/index.cfm?lat=34.57944&amp;lon=-118.09896&amp;type=1&amp;zoom=50&amp;scale=24000&amp;icon=0&amp;BPID=MAP0060030900"><span><b>Click here</b></span></a> for a zoomable, topographical map of the area.</p><p><b>DESCRIPTION / ZONING:</b><br/><b></b></p><p>The land is generally raw remote acreage that is primarily zoned for agricultural uses, which generally do allow for a residence to be built on the property. Although the zoning may allow for the building of a residence, there are no utilities, no improved roads, and no homeowner services of any kind on most of the parcels, unless otherwise stated. As is the case with any place in America, PRIOR to the building of a residence; you would have to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and conditions of the County and other governmental agencies.</p><h4><b>USE:</b><br/><b></b></h4><p>Use the property to camp, enjoy the great outdoors, hike, hunt, horseback ride, ride off-road vehicles, future speculation purposes, or as an asset to pass on to the children or grandchildren.</p><p><b>ACCESS:</b><br/> The parcels generally are accessed by unimproved dirt roads. Some parcels have no direct road access, but have a dirt road into the general vicinity of the parcels. Other parcels may have paved road access/frontage. Each parcel is different and information is available regarding the access on each of the various parcels.</p><h4><b>PROPERTY SURVEYS:</b></h4><p>We have not had surveys done on the properties, unless noted. The approximate cost to survey, by a licensed surveyor, for a parcel in Los Angeles County is APPROXIMATELY $300-$600.00. This is only an approximate amount that can change due to a parcel's location. We can provide names of surveyors that will give an exact quote for any parcel being purchased.</p><h4><b>WATER:</b><br/><b></b></h4><p>There are no water service lines to the parcels, unless specifically noted. Water on the parcels would be obtained by drilling a well. Because of the number of parcels we have and the various locations, we have no information regarding depth of water, type of water, or the cost to drill a well. We suggest you contact a local well driller if you need any information on wells. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SUCCESS OF A WELL.</p><h4><b>MINERAL RIGHTS:</b><br/><b></b></h4><p>Information on mineral rights varies from parcel to parcel. Most of the parcels have mineral rights, or a portion of the mineral rights. Whatever mineral rights we own will be transferred to the buyer, when the property is deeded.</p><h4><b>PROPERTY TAXES:</b><br/><b></b></h4><p>The annual amount varies on each parcel. You will be given the approximate amount of property taxes charged by the county for the most recent tax year. A good rule of thumb is to figure 1.25% of the purchase price of the property.</p><p> </p><h6><span>All information/materials/pictures contained in this website is owned by smv corp.
